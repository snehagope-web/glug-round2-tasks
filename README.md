GLUG Round 2 Tasks

This repository contains my submissions for the GLUG Round 2 task.

Projects:
1. Weather App – A responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data using an API.
2. MUKTI Poster – A graphic design poster created for the MUKTI open-source event, following GLUG’s design style.

I am a beginner in web development and graphic design, and I focused on learning and implementing core concepts while completing these tasks.
