Weather App

This is a responsive weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features:
- Dynamic city search
- Fetches real-time weather data using OpenWeather API
- Displays current weather and 5-day forecast
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

Note:
I am new to JavaScript and focused on understanding API usage, fetch, and DOM manipulation while building this project.
